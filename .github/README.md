# 101 -- Introduction to computers, the internet, & the web

Hello! This repository is the first step in the process of learning web
development and software engineering. Whether you're wanting to be a support
engineer, data scientist/engineer, front end engineer, or back end engineer, the
knowledge listed here will be foundational for the rest of your journey.

The content for this module is entirely informational, and there are no projects
or assignments
([open an issue](https://github.com/nickcannariato/intro-to-web-and-computers/issues/new)
and let us know if you think we should change that). Take your time and work
through each resource, asking questions in our Slack channel whenever you get
confused.

When you finish, you'll be moving on to
[110 -- HTML, CSS, Sass, & basic static sites](https://github.com/nickcannariato/html-css-and-basic-static-sites).

## Syllabus

### Part 1: What are computers, what is the internet, and what is the web

Before we start digging into code, building things on our computers, and putting
those things on the internet, we're going to back up a little bit and learn
exactly what the hell those things are.

**_Don't panic!_** There is a _lot_ of information contained in the articles and
videos linked below. There isn't a test, and you don't need to memorize the
information contained within. Think of this less like information you _need to
remember forever_ and more like kindling that can catch fire when you're
learning other things or encountering errors along the way. The more "kindling"
in your pile, the more things can "ignite" when you encounter concepts, errors,
or code you've never seen before.

### Part 2: Meet your Computer all over again (via the Terminal)

Now that you have a general sense of the internet, how it connects computers,
and how those computers themselves are working with information; we're going to
take our first step into software development by learning how to interact with
our computers using the terminal.

This information is a little more practical and "hands on" than the information
above, so regardless of whether you pick the book or video option, make sure
that you follow along in an open terminal. Active learning and muscle memory
will help later!
